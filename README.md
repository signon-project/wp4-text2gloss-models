# AMR models SignON

This repository contains the models that can be used inside the SignON pipeline in the text-to-AMR component.

Note that the models are linked as git submodules. To clone all of the models from their submodules, use

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/signon-project/wp4-text2gloss-models.git
```

The models are also available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/BramVanroy/multilingual-text-to-amr-650b0fd576856b9acb257535).
